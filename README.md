## About Me (🇺🇦,🇨🇦)

Hi, I'm Viktor from Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, due to the unprovoked and barbaric full-scale invasion by Russia on Ukraine, I was forced to leave my home. Currently, I reside in Canada and am actively assisting the local Ukrainian community in integrating into the Canadian landscape.
